 This is a coding example working on IRIS 2020.1 
 It will not be kept in sync with new versions      
 It is also NOT serviced by InterSystems Support !   
~~~ 

IRIS 2010.1 brought us a new feature: %Net.WebSocket.Client  

As a continuation of my series of WS Clients I just couldn't resist to try it.  
Well, this is the result and it was rather simple in the end.    
   - After I succeeded in my personal fight against Windows Firewall ;-)   
   
You basically need to prepare 3 classes:  
- Credentials for User,  PW, SSL   
- an Event Listener
- the Client  (Could be a .MAC routine as well) 

The example uses the WSS.EchoServer (a derivate from former SAMPLES in Caché).  
The default assumption is to have Client and Server on the same system & namespace.  
But if you have some other echo server (e.g. ws://echo.websocket.org)    
you just pass the URL as param.  

You start it  
by DO ##CLASS(WSCI.Client).Try()  
or DO ##CLASS(WSCI.Client).Try(server_url)
